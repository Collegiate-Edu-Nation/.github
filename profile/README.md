## Collegiate Edu-Nation

Collegiate Edu-Nation is a non-profit organization engaging whole communities to reinvigorate education, revitalize local economies, and reimagine what’s possible for rural America. We’re preparing rural communities to connect and thrive in a fast-moving future.

This revitalization encompasses placement in high-wage, high-demand careers, which we aim to accomplish via content-aligned STEM competitions, for which several open source tools are made available here.
